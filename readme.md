# Create an app

This creates a fullstack app using Hapi on the backend and React on the front end. This setup is my current stack that I feel makes me super productive. It creates a Hapi based API and GraphQL server, a React based front end and uses Webpack to build the assets. For the database access it has an included Docker Compose file that includes PostgresSQL, MongoDB, Redis and Neo4j.

## Usage

```
npm init @kev_nz myapp
```
